# Text-Based Adventure Game

## Project Overview
This project is a text-based adventure game designed as part of a lab exercise for learning Python programming and software development fundamentals. 
The game allows players to navigate between rooms, view descriptions, and interact through text commands. The goal is to understand the basics of game logic, functions, and testing.

## Setup Instructions
1.Download the template:
Download game1_template.zip from Learning Central and extract it to a working folder.

2.Install Python:
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

3.Run the Game:

-Open a terminal or command prompt.

-Navigate to the extracted folder.

-Run the game: 'python game.py'

4.Run Tests:
Use doctest to verify functionality: 'python -m doctest -v game.py'

## Project Details
### Step 1: Template Setup
The provided template includes two files:

-map.py: Defines the game world, including rooms and exits.

-game.py: Contains the main game logic, functions, and a game loop.

Start by exploring these files and understanding their structure.

### Step 2: Completing Functions
